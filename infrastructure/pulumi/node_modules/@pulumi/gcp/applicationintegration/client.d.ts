 * Application Integration Client.
 *
 * To get more information about Client, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.clients)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/overview)
 *     * [Set up Application Integration](https://cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/setup-application-integration)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Integrations Client Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const example = new gcp.applicationintegration.Client("example", {location: "us-central1"});
 * ```
 * ### Integrations Client Full
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const testProject = gcp.organizations.getProject({});
 * const keyring = new gcp.kms.KeyRing("keyring", {
 *     name: "my-keyring",
 *     location: "us-east1",
 * });
 * const cryptokey = new gcp.kms.CryptoKey("cryptokey", {
 *     name: "crypto-key-example",
 *     keyRing: keyring.id,
 *     rotationPeriod: "7776000s",
 * });
 * const testKey = new gcp.kms.CryptoKeyVersion("test_key", {cryptoKey: cryptokey.id});
 * const serviceAccount = new gcp.serviceaccount.Account("service_account", {
 *     accountId: "service-acc",
 *     displayName: "Service Account",
 * });
 * const example = new gcp.applicationintegration.Client("example", {
 *     location: "us-east1",
 *     createSampleIntegrations: true,
 *     runAsServiceAccount: serviceAccount.email,
 *     cloudKmsConfig: {
 *         kmsLocation: "us-east1",
 *         kmsRing: keyring.id,
 *         key: cryptokey.id,
 *         keyVersion: testKey.id,
 *         kmsProjectId: testProject.then(testProject => testProject.projectId),
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Client can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/clients`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}`
 *
 * * `{{location}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Client can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:applicationintegration/client:Client default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/clients
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:applicationintegration/client:Client default {{project}}/{{location}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:applicationintegration/client:Client default {{location}}
 * ```
