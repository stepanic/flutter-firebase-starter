 *
 * Dataset can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/datasets/{{dataset_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{dataset_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{dataset_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Dataset can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:bigquery/dataset:Dataset default projects/{{project}}/datasets/{{dataset_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:bigquery/dataset:Dataset default {{project}}/{{dataset_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:bigquery/dataset:Dataset default {{dataset_id}}
 * ```
