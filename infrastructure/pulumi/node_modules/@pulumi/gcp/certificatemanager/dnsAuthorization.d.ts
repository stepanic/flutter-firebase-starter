/**
 * DnsAuthorization represents a HTTP-reachable backend for a DnsAuthorization.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Certificate Manager Dns Authorization Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const _default = new gcp.certificatemanager.DnsAuthorization("default", {
 *     name: "dns-auth",
 *     location: "global",
 *     description: "The default dns",
 *     domain: "subdomain.hashicorptest.com",
 * });
 * export const recordNameToInsert = _default.dnsResourceRecords.apply(dnsResourceRecords => dnsResourceRecords[0].name);
 * export const recordTypeToInsert = _default.dnsResourceRecords.apply(dnsResourceRecords => dnsResourceRecords[0].type);
 * export const recordDataToInsert = _default.dnsResourceRecords.apply(dnsResourceRecords => dnsResourceRecords[0].data);
 * ```
 * ### Certificate Manager Dns Authorization Regional
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const _default = new gcp.certificatemanager.DnsAuthorization("default", {
 *     name: "dns-auth",
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     description: "reginal dns",
 *     type: "PER_PROJECT_RECORD",
 *     domain: "subdomain.hashicorptest.com",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * DnsAuthorization can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/dnsAuthorizations/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{location}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, DnsAuthorization can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:certificatemanager/dnsAuthorization:DnsAuthorization default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/dnsAuthorizations/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:certificatemanager/dnsAuthorization:DnsAuthorization default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:certificatemanager/dnsAuthorization:DnsAuthorization default {{location}}/{{name}}
 * ```
