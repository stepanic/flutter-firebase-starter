 * Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for Dataplex EntryType. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
 *
 * * `gcp.dataplex.EntryTypeIamPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the entrytype and replaces any existing policy already attached.
 * * `gcp.dataplex.EntryTypeIamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the entrytype are preserved.
 * * `gcp.dataplex.EntryTypeIamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the entrytype are preserved.
 *
 * A data source can be used to retrieve policy data in advent you do not need creation
 *
 * * `gcp.dataplex.EntryTypeIamPolicy`: Retrieves the IAM policy for the entrytype
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.dataplex.EntryTypeIamPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.dataplex.EntryTypeIamBinding` and `gcp.dataplex.EntryTypeIamMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.dataplex.EntryTypeIamBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.dataplex.EntryTypeIamMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.

 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * For all import syntaxes, the "resource in question" can take any of the following forms:
 *
 * * projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/entryTypes/{{entry_type_id}}
 *
 * * {{project}}/{{location}}/{{entry_type_id}}
 *
 * * {{location}}/{{entry_type_id}}
 *
 * * {{entry_type_id}}
 *
 * Any variables not passed in the import command will be taken from the provider configuration.
 *
 * Dataplex entrytype IAM resources can be imported using the resource identifiers, role, and member.
 *
 * IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question, the role, and the member identity, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:dataplex/entryTypeIamPolicy:EntryTypeIamPolicy editor "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/entryTypes/{{entry_type_id}} roles/viewer user:jane@example.com"
 * ```
 *
 * IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question and the role, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:dataplex/entryTypeIamPolicy:EntryTypeIamPolicy editor "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/entryTypes/{{entry_type_id}} roles/viewer"
 * ```
 *
 * IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:dataplex/entryTypeIamPolicy:EntryTypeIamPolicy editor projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/entryTypes/{{entry_type_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * -> **Custom Roles**: If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the
 *
 *  full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/my-project|organizations/my-org]/roles/my-custom-role`.
