/**
 * Represents the settings related to security issues, such as data redaction and data retention. It may take hours for updates on the settings to propagate to all the related components and take effect.
 * Multiple security settings can be configured in each location. Each agent can specify the security settings to apply, and each setting can be applied to multiple agents in the same project and location.
 *
 * To get more information about SecuritySettings, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/reference/rest/v3/projects.locations.securitySettings)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Dialogflowcx Security Settings Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const basicSecuritySettings = new gcp.diagflow.CxSecuritySettings("basic_security_settings", {
 *     displayName: "dialogflowcx-security-settings",
 *     location: "global",
 *     purgeDataTypes: [],
 *     retentionWindowDays: 7,
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Dialogflowcx Security Settings Full
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const inspect = new gcp.dataloss.PreventionInspectTemplate("inspect", {
 *     parent: "projects/my-project-name/locations/global",
 *     displayName: "dialogflowcx-inspect-template",
 *     inspectConfig: {
 *         infoTypes: [{
 *             name: "EMAIL_ADDRESS",
 *         }],
 *     },
 * });
 * const deidentify = new gcp.dataloss.PreventionDeidentifyTemplate("deidentify", {
 *     parent: "projects/my-project-name/locations/global",
 *     displayName: "dialogflowcx-deidentify-template",
 *     deidentifyConfig: {
 *         infoTypeTransformations: {
 *             transformations: [{
 *                 primitiveTransformation: {

 *                     },
 *                 },
 *             }],
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * const bucket = new gcp.storage.Bucket("bucket", {
 *     name: "dialogflowcx-bucket",
 *     location: "US",
 *     uniformBucketLevelAccess: true,
 * });
 * const basicSecuritySettings = new gcp.diagflow.CxSecuritySettings("basic_security_settings", {
 *     displayName: "dialogflowcx-security-settings",
 *     location: "global",
 *     redactionStrategy: "REDACT_WITH_SERVICE",
 *     redactionScope: "REDACT_DISK_STORAGE",
 *     inspectTemplate: inspect.id,
 *     deidentifyTemplate: deidentify.id,
 *     purgeDataTypes: ["DIALOGFLOW_HISTORY"],
 *     audioExportSettings: {
 *         gcsBucket: bucket.id,
 *         audioExportPattern: "export",
 *         enableAudioRedaction: true,
 *         audioFormat: "OGG",
 *     },
 *     insightsExportSettings: {
 *         enableInsightsExport: true,
 *     },
 *     retentionStrategy: "REMOVE_AFTER_CONVERSATION",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * SecuritySettings can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/securitySettings/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{location}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, SecuritySettings can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:diagflow/cxSecuritySettings:CxSecuritySettings default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/securitySettings/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:diagflow/cxSecuritySettings:CxSecuritySettings default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:diagflow/cxSecuritySettings:CxSecuritySettings default {{location}}/{{name}}
 * ```
