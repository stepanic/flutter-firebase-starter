 * * `gcp.iap.AppEngineVersionIamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the appengineversion are preserved.
 * * `gcp.iap.AppEngineVersionIamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the appengineversion are preserved.
 *
 * A data source can be used to retrieve policy data in advent you do not need creation

 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * For all import syntaxes, the "resource in question" can take any of the following forms:
 *
 * * projects/{{project}}/iap_web/appengine-{{appId}}/services/{{service}}/versions/{{versionId}}
 *
 * * {{project}}/{{appId}}/{{service}}/{{versionId}}
 *
 * * {{appId}}/{{service}}/{{versionId}}
 *
 * * {{version}}
 *
 * Any variables not passed in the import command will be taken from the provider configuration.
 *
 * Identity-Aware Proxy appengineversion IAM resources can be imported using the resource identifiers, role, and member.
 *
 * IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question, the role, and the member identity, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:iap/appEngineVersionIamBinding:AppEngineVersionIamBinding editor "projects/{{project}}/iap_web/appengine-{{appId}}/services/{{service}}/versions/{{versionId}} roles/iap.httpsResourceAccessor user:jane@example.com"
 * ```
 *
 * IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question and the role, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:iap/appEngineVersionIamBinding:AppEngineVersionIamBinding editor "projects/{{project}}/iap_web/appengine-{{appId}}/services/{{service}}/versions/{{versionId}} roles/iap.httpsResourceAccessor"
 * ```
 *
 * IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:iap/appEngineVersionIamBinding:AppEngineVersionIamBinding editor projects/{{project}}/iap_web/appengine-{{appId}}/services/{{service}}/versions/{{versionId}}
 * ```
 *
 * -> **Custom Roles**: If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the
 *
 *  full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/my-project|organizations/my-org]/roles/my-custom-role`.
