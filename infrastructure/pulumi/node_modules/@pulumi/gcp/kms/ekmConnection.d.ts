/**
 * `Ekm Connections` are used to control the connection settings for an `EXTERNAL_VPC` CryptoKey.
 * It is used to connect customer's external key manager to Google Cloud EKM.
 *
 * > **Note:** Ekm Connections cannot be deleted from Google Cloud Platform.
 *
 * To get more information about EkmConnection, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.ekmConnections)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Creating a Ekm Connection](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/create-ekm-connection)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Kms Ekm Connection Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const example_ekmconnection = new gcp.kms.EkmConnection("example-ekmconnection", {
 *     name: "ekmconnection_example",
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     keyManagementMode: "MANUAL",
 *     serviceResolvers: [{
 *         serviceDirectoryService: "projects/project_id/locations/us-central1/namespaces/namespace_name/services/service_name",
 *         hostname: "example-ekm.goog",
 *         serverCertificates: [{
 *             rawDer: "==HAwIBCCAr6gAwIBAgIUWR+EV4lqiV7Ql12VY==",
 *         }],
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * EkmConnection can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/ekmConnections/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{location}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, EkmConnection can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:kms/ekmConnection:EkmConnection default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/ekmConnections/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:kms/ekmConnection:EkmConnection default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:kms/ekmConnection:EkmConnection default {{location}}/{{name}}
 * ```
