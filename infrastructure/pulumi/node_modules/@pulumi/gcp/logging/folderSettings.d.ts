/**
 * Default resource settings control whether CMEK is required for new log buckets. These settings also determine the storage location for the _Default and _Required log buckets, and whether the _Default sink is enabled or disabled.
 *
 * To get more information about FolderSettings, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/TopLevel/getSettings)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Configure default settings for organizations and folders](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/default-settings)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Logging Folder Settings All
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const myFolder = new gcp.organizations.Folder("my_folder", {
 *     displayName: "folder-name",
 *     parent: "organizations/123456789",
 * });
 * const settings = gcp.logging.getFolderSettingsOutput({
 *     folder: myFolder.folderId,
 * });
 * const iam = new gcp.kms.CryptoKeyIAMMember("iam", {
 *     cryptoKeyId: "kms-key",
 *     role: "roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter",
 *     member: settings.apply(settings => `serviceAccount:${settings.kmsServiceAccountId}`),
 * });
 * const example = new gcp.logging.FolderSettings("example", {
 *     disableDefaultSink: true,
 *     folder: myFolder.folderId,
 *     kmsKeyName: "kms-key",
 *     storageLocation: "us-central1",
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [iam],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * FolderSettings can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `folders/{{folder}}/settings`
 *
 * * `{{folder}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, FolderSettings can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:logging/folderSettings:FolderSettings default folders/{{folder}}/settings
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:logging/folderSettings:FolderSettings default {{folder}}
 * ```
