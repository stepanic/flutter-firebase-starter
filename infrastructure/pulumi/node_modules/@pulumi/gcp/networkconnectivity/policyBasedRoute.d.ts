/**
 * Policy-based Routes are more powerful routes that route L4 network traffic based on not just destination IP, but also source IP, protocol and more. A Policy-based Route always take precedence when it conflicts with other types of routes.
 *
 * To get more information about PolicyBasedRoute, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/reference/networkconnectivity/rest/v1/projects.locations.global.policyBasedRoutes)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Use policy-based routes](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/use-policy-based-routes#api)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Network Connectivity Policy Based Route Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const myNetwork = new gcp.compute.Network("my_network", {
 *     name: "my-network",
 *     autoCreateSubnetworks: false,
 * });
 * const _default = new gcp.networkconnectivity.PolicyBasedRoute("default", {
 *     name: "my-pbr",
 *     network: myNetwork.id,
 *     filter: {
 *         protocolVersion: "IPV4",
 *     },
 *     nextHopOtherRoutes: "DEFAULT_ROUTING",
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Network Connectivity Policy Based Route Full
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const myNetwork = new gcp.compute.Network("my_network", {
 *     name: "my-network",
 *     autoCreateSubnetworks: false,
 * });
 * // This example substitutes an arbitrary internal IP for an internal network
 * // load balancer for brevity. Consult https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/internal
 * // to set one up.
 * const ilb = new gcp.compute.GlobalAddress("ilb", {name: "my-ilb"});
 * const _default = new gcp.networkconnectivity.PolicyBasedRoute("default", {
 *     name: "my-pbr",
 *     description: "My routing policy",
 *     network: myNetwork.id,
 *     priority: 2302,
 *     filter: {
 *         protocolVersion: "IPV4",
 *         ipProtocol: "UDP",
 *         srcRange: "10.0.0.0/24",
 *         destRange: "0.0.0.0/0",
 *     },
 *     nextHopIlbIp: ilb.address,
 *     virtualMachine: {
 *         tags: ["restricted"],
 *     },
 *     labels: {
 *         env: "default",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * PolicyBasedRoute can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/global/policyBasedRoutes/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, PolicyBasedRoute can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networkconnectivity/policyBasedRoute:PolicyBasedRoute default projects/{{project}}/locations/global/policyBasedRoutes/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networkconnectivity/policyBasedRoute:PolicyBasedRoute default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networkconnectivity/policyBasedRoute:PolicyBasedRoute default {{name}}
 * ```
