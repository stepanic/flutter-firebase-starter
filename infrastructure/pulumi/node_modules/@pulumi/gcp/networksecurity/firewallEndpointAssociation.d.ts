/**
 * Firewall endpoint association links a firewall endpoint to a VPC network in
 * the same zone. After you define this association, Cloud Firewall forwards the
 * zonal workload traffic in your VPC network that requires layer 7 inspection to
 * the attached firewall endpoint.
 *
 * To get more information about FirewallEndpointAssociation, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/firewall/docs/reference/network-security/rest/v1/projects.locations.firewallEndpointAssociations#FirewallEndpointAssociation)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Create and associate firewall endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/firewall/docs/configure-firewall-endpoints)
 *     * [Firewall endpoint overview](https://cloud.google.com/firewall/docs/about-firewall-endpoints)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Network Security Firewall Endpoint Association Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const _default = new gcp.networksecurity.FirewallEndpoint("default", {
 *     name: "my-firewall-endpoint",
 *     parent: "organizations/123456789",
 *     location: "us-central1-a",
 *     labels: {
 *         foo: "bar",
 *     },
 * });
 * const defaultAssociation = new gcp.networksecurity.FirewallEndpointAssociation("default_association", {
 *     name: "my-firewall-endpoint-association",
 *     parent: "projects/my-project-name",
 *     location: "us-central1-a",
 *     labels: {
 *         foo: "bar",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * FirewallEndpointAssociation can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `{{parent}}/locations/{{location}}/firewallEndpointAssociations/{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, FirewallEndpointAssociation can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networksecurity/firewallEndpointAssociation:FirewallEndpointAssociation default {{parent}}/locations/{{location}}/firewallEndpointAssociations/{{name}}
 * ```
