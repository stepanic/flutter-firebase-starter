 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * GrpcRoute can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/global/grpcRoutes/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, GrpcRoute can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networkservices/grpcRoute:GrpcRoute default projects/{{project}}/locations/global/grpcRoutes/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networkservices/grpcRoute:GrpcRoute default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networkservices/grpcRoute:GrpcRoute default {{name}}
 * ```
