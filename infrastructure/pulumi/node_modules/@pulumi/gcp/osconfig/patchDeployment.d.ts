/**
 * Patch deployments are configurations that individual patch jobs use to complete a patch.
 * These configurations include instance filter, package repository settings, and a schedule.
 *
 * To get more information about PatchDeployment, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/osconfig/rest)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/os-patch-management)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Os Config Patch Deployment Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const patch = new gcp.osconfig.PatchDeployment("patch", {
 *     patchDeploymentId: "patch-deploy",
 *     instanceFilter: {
 *         all: true,
 *     },

 * ## Import
 *
 * PatchDeployment can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/patchDeployments/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, PatchDeployment can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:osconfig/patchDeployment:PatchDeployment default projects/{{project}}/patchDeployments/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:osconfig/patchDeployment:PatchDeployment default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:osconfig/patchDeployment:PatchDeployment default {{name}}
 * ```
