import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Parallelstore Instance Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const network = new gcp.compute.Network("network", {
 *     name: "network",
 *     autoCreateSubnetworks: true,
 *     mtu: 8896,
 * });
 * // Create an IP address
 * const privateIpAlloc = new gcp.compute.GlobalAddress("private_ip_alloc", {
 *     name: "address",
 *     purpose: "VPC_PEERING",
 *     addressType: "INTERNAL",
 *     prefixLength: 24,
 *     network: network.id,
 * });
 * // Create a private connection
 * const _default = new gcp.servicenetworking.Connection("default", {
 *     network: network.id,
 *     service: "servicenetworking.googleapis.com",
 *     reservedPeeringRanges: [privateIpAlloc.name],
 * });
 * const instance = new gcp.parallelstore.Instance("instance", {
 *     instanceId: "instance",
 *     location: "us-central1-a",
 *     description: "test instance",
 *     capacityGib: "12000",
 *     network: network.name,
 *     fileStripeLevel: "FILE_STRIPE_LEVEL_MIN",
 *     directoryStripeLevel: "DIRECTORY_STRIPE_LEVEL_MIN",
 *     labels: {
 *         test: "value",
 *     },
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [_default],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Instance can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{instance_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{location}}/{{instance_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Instance can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:parallelstore/instance:Instance default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:parallelstore/instance:Instance default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{instance_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:parallelstore/instance:Instance default {{location}}/{{instance_id}}
 * ```
