/**
 * Mute Findings is a volume management feature in Security Command Center
 * that lets you manually or programmatically hide irrelevant findings,
 * and create filters to automatically silence existing and future
 * findings based on criteria you specify.
 *
 * To get more information about FolderMuteConfig, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/reference/rest/v2/folders.muteConfigs)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Scc V2 Folder Mute Config Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const folder = new gcp.organizations.Folder("folder", {
 *     parent: "organizations/123456789",
 *     displayName: "folder-name",
 * });
 * const _default = new gcp.securitycenter.V2FolderMuteConfig("default", {
 *     muteConfigId: "my-config",
 *     folder: folder.folderId,
 *     location: "global",
 *     description: "My custom Cloud Security Command Center Finding Folder mute Configuration",
 *     filter: "severity = \"HIGH\"",
 *     type: "STATIC",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * FolderMuteConfig can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `folders/{{folder}}/locations/{{location}}/muteConfigs/{{mute_config_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{folder}}/{{location}}/{{mute_config_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, FolderMuteConfig can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:securitycenter/v2FolderMuteConfig:V2FolderMuteConfig default folders/{{folder}}/locations/{{location}}/muteConfigs/{{mute_config_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:securitycenter/v2FolderMuteConfig:V2FolderMuteConfig default {{folder}}/{{location}}/{{mute_config_id}}
 * ```
