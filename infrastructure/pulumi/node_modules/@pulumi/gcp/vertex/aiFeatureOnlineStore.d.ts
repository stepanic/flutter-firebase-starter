/**
 * Vertex AI Feature Online Store provides a centralized repository for serving ML features and embedding indexes at low latency. The Feature Online Store is a top-level container.
 *
 * To get more information about FeatureOnlineStore, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.featureOnlineStores)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Vertex Ai Feature Online Store
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const featureOnlineStore = new gcp.vertex.AiFeatureOnlineStore("feature_online_store", {
 *     name: "example_feature_online_store",
 *     labels: {
 *         foo: "bar",
 *     },
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     bigtable: {
 *         autoScaling: {
 *             minNodeCount: 1,
 *             maxNodeCount: 3,
 *             cpuUtilizationTarget: 50,
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Vertex Ai Featureonlinestore With Optimized
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const project = gcp.organizations.getProject({});
 * const featureonlinestore = new gcp.vertex.AiFeatureOnlineStore("featureonlinestore", {
 *     name: "example_feature_online_store_optimized",
 *     labels: {
 *         foo: "bar",
 *     },
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     optimized: {},
 *     dedicatedServingEndpoint: {
 *         privateServiceConnectConfig: {
 *             enablePrivateServiceConnect: true,
 *             projectAllowlists: [project.then(project => project.number)],
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Vertex Ai Featureonlinestore With Beta Fields Bigtable
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const featureonlinestore = new gcp.vertex.AiFeatureOnlineStore("featureonlinestore", {
 *     name: "example_feature_online_store_beta_bigtable",
 *     labels: {
 *         foo: "bar",
 *     },
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     bigtable: {
 *         autoScaling: {
 *             minNodeCount: 1,
 *             maxNodeCount: 2,
 *             cpuUtilizationTarget: 80,
 *         },
 *     },
 *     embeddingManagement: {
 *         enabled: true,
 *     },
 *     forceDestroy: true,
 * });
 * const project = gcp.organizations.getProject({});
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * FeatureOnlineStore can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{region}}/featureOnlineStores/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{region}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, FeatureOnlineStore can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:vertex/aiFeatureOnlineStore:AiFeatureOnlineStore default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{region}}/featureOnlineStores/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:vertex/aiFeatureOnlineStore:AiFeatureOnlineStore default {{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:vertex/aiFeatureOnlineStore:AiFeatureOnlineStore default {{region}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:vertex/aiFeatureOnlineStore:AiFeatureOnlineStore default {{name}}
 * ```
