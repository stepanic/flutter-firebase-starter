 * Serverless VPC Access connector resource.
 *
 * To get more information about Connector, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/reference/vpcaccess/rest/v1/projects.locations.connectors)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Configuring Serverless VPC Access](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-serverless-vpc-access)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Vpc Access Connector
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const connector = new gcp.vpcaccess.Connector("connector", {
 *     name: "vpc-con",
 *     ipCidrRange: "10.8.0.0/28",
 *     network: "default",
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Vpc Access Connector Shared Vpc
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const customTest = new gcp.compute.Subnetwork("custom_test", {
 *     name: "vpc-con",
 *     ipCidrRange: "10.2.0.0/28",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     network: "default",
 * });
 * const connector = new gcp.vpcaccess.Connector("connector", {
 *     name: "vpc-con",
 *     subnet: {
 *         name: customTest.name,
 *     },
 *     machineType: "e2-standard-4",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Connector can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{region}}/connectors/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{region}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Connector can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:vpcaccess/connector:Connector default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{region}}/connectors/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:vpcaccess/connector:Connector default {{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:vpcaccess/connector:Connector default {{region}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:vpcaccess/connector:Connector default {{name}}
 * ```
